## How to start?

---

### First:
```angular2html
npm run init
```
### Then open another terminal window and exec:
```angular2html
npm run start-server
```

*This will start local server (default port - 8081)*

### And finally open another one terminal window and exec:
```angular2html
npm run start-client
```
Now both client and server are up!

Open http://localhost:8080 several times and try to manipulate with canvas.

Some debug console.log's are included
